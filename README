============= How to Build =================

What you will need:

libgstreamer-0.10-dev
Qt4 development libraries
Boost
CMake

How to get Boost:

It's best to do a SVN checkout of boost's trunk, to do that following the directions here:
http://www.boost.org/users/download/#repository

Once you have boost checked out, you'll need to build boost. After you've built boost you
must create an environment variable called BOOST_ROOT. This works best if you add it to
the .bashrc config file. This way the BOOST_ROOT variable is always exported when using
the terminal. You can edit the bashrc file by running this command:

gedit ~/.bashrc

Once .bashrc is open you can add the following line anywhere in the file:

export BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/your/boost/checkout/

The path must be pointing to the top level directory in the your boost checkout. After you
add this you can save the config file and close gedit, you'll also need to spawn a new instance
of the terminal in order for the effects to take place.

After this you can start building wraithmedia:

cd /path/to/wraithmedia/checkout
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Once it's built you can run it by typing the following command in the build directory:

./wraith
